Civil Beat hasn't yet updated their <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2025/02/the-sunshine-blog-blissful-ignorance-of-new-state-disclosure-law/">story</a> on elected officials not filing the appropriate information in their (our) ethics disclosures indicating a relationship with a registered lobbyist.

I had posted a comment to their website, which they've deleted. I'll sum it up here: On 1/31, I  filed an ethics disclosure indicating that my spouse is a lobbyist, doing amazing public-interest work at Earthjustice. It seems that there is a problems with the Ethics website, which did not correctly surface my info to the journalists at Civil Beat.

Civil Beat deleted the comment. They said that they would be reaching out to Ethics and would update their story. I haven't seen an update. So I'm posting this here to make it clear that I indeed post the correct info on my Ethics disclosure.

Have a good rest of the week.
